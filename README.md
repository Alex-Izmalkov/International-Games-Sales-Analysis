# International-Games-Sales-Analysis

- This is an integrated project I did during my studies at Practicum100.

- The project contains a data analysis for an online store which sells video games all over the world.

- I scrutinize a dataset containing data on games and gaming platforms, genres, user and expert reviews, and sales in different regions. 

- The goal is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not in order to spot potential big winners and for further advertising campaigns planning.

- The project includes EDA, dealing with missing values, building graphs nad implementing statistical tests.
